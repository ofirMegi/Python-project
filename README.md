# Python-project
With this script you could do actions on S3 bucket, EC2 instance and Route53;
you can create, update, delete them.
To run this script you will need to have python 3.8-3.12(or the boto3 won't work).
In this script if you don't have boto3 or awscli it will download them with pip install.
You can connect to the aws from the script but make sure you enter the correct information!
It's easy to use, it's client convenient.
Hope you will find it useful!
